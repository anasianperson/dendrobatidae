                       The terrarium is essential for any sort of reptile or amphibian. A terrarium or 
                       vivarium is essentially a container in which any animal (in this case a dart frog) can
                       live in. A vivarium can be built using one of the methods shown below:
                       <br/>
                       Method one: This method is the simplest, but usually the ugliest method. 
                       The procedure is as follows: First, you will want to put a drainage layer at 
                       the bottom of the tank. A drainage layer is for making sure that your tank is 
                       swamped by water and becomes a marsh. Generally for this method you will 
                       want to use either gravel or a synthetic light-weight substiture (e.g. 
                       terralite and hydroballs) for your drainage layer. You'll around an inch of
                       drainage.You then want to put a substrate, preferably ABG (Atlanta Botanical
                       Garden) mix. This medium  will provide an excellent growing medium for your 
                       plants and microfauna. You'll want around one and a half inches of ABG usually.
                       Then you will want to add your decorations, like rocks and wood. Then you 
                       may start planting. These plants are the easiest plants to care for and they 
                       will grow niceley for you: Pothos, Philodendron, Ficus, Bromeliads, Dracena,
                       Pepperomia, and mosses like Java, sheet, and Mood Moss. Then you can add 
                       microfauna. These are essentialy the janitos of the vivarium, breaking down
                       feces and converting them into mediums suitable for plant use. The easiest 
                       microfauna to use are Springtails (Collemba sp.). These can be easily bought
                       online or you can find them in woodland areas under leaf litter. These are 
                       tiny insects, barley visible to the human eye. After that, add a shallow
                       water bowl, and then put on a glass top and a flourescent bulb, and a heat 
                       mat on the side of the tank if the area where the tank will be is less than 
                       70 degrees during the night (or you can put this on the bottom of the tank
                       before you start building), you're done! Measure the tank temperatures for 
                       about a week, and if all goes good, then you can add frogs after an additional
                       two weeks of cycling.
